In your home, you have level09 and a token

When you execute level09 binary with aaaaa in argument, output is :

abcde

The binary level09 perform a ciphering by shift of n + 1 by character read.
We can create a program that cancels this encryption (see main.c)

scp main.c level09@[IP]:/tmp

cd /tmp && gcc main.c -o decript

Get the token :
./decript ~/token
