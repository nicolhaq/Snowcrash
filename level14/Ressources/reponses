Nothing at home...

try getflag

Nope there is no token here for you sorry. Try again :)

try gdb /bin/getflag
run

You should not reverse this

Ok, the programme check if it launch with a debugger, probably with ptrace

In gdb, set a breakpoint in main with b main
run
show asm code with layout asm

0x8048989 <main+67> call 0x8048540 ptrace@plt
0x804898e <main+72> test %eax,%eax
0x8048990 <main+74> jns 0x80489a8 <main+98>

Bingo !

set a breakpoint to the next instruction: b *0x804898e

change the return of ptrace with set var $eax=1 continue

Nope there is no token here for you sorry. Try again :)

Ok now the programme check if we have the good right, probbly with getuid

Get the uid of flag14 with id -u flag14

3014

Follow the next of the code until getuid and found this:

0x8048b06 <main+448> mov 0x18(%esp),%eax
0x8048b0a <main+452> cmp $0xbbe,%eax

Change a breakpoint at 0x8048b0a with b *0x8048b0a continue

Change the return of getuid with set var $eax=3014

continue
